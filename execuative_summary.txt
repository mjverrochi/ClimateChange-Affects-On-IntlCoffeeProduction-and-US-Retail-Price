With Reddit being one of the more popular websites online, knowing what may or may not affects a post's engagement is valuable information.
The more engagement on one's post, the more their message is seen. That is one of the reasons why we analyzed over 12,000 reddit posts to 
see if there were any patterns indicating this.

We analyzed how the title of a post could affect the overall engagement (number of comments). After creating a model predictor, we were able to 
predict correctly over 55% of the time whether or not a post was in the top 50th percentile of the median of our dataset based on title.
We found that "just", "like", "new", and "time" are the top 4 words found in all Reddit post titles, 
for posts in the top 50th percentile of the median of our dataset.

In our continued efforts, we plan to increase our accuracy by looking at further data features including, but not limited to,
whether a post is tagged as over 18, containg a spoiler, or contains a video.
